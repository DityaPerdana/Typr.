## Devlog
The development of typr began with a basic Vue.js prototype and evolved through several phases: initial bug fixing (addressing word generation errors, cursor alignment, and timer cleanup), enhancing user experience (switching to keydown events for responsiveness, adding accuracy metrics), rebranding from HippoType to typr, and finally a complete UI/UX overhaul with a modern color palette, improved layout, and polished interactions, resulting in a stable, enjoyable, and visually appealing typing game.
